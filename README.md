### HI, I'm Unicorn (any/they/them)

I'm a pan/nonbinary beginner programmer from Germany.

I'm currently mostly learning rust and some webstuff, but I also work with python from time to time

If you want to know more about me or what I do, why don't you visit my [website](https://unicornyrainbow.org)?
